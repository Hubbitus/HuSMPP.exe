Windows application (C++, MFC, Boost) to connect to GSM/CDMA providers (some aggregators like [http://incoremedia.ru/ IncoreMedia] aditionally supported) via [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Message_Peer-to-Peer SMPP protocol] version 3.4 and handle send and receive SMS messages.

Some features to highlight:
# Support Receiver, Transmitter and Transceiver modes.
# Async work support implemented for big workload (disabled).
# Work with MSSQL database to store messages and send.
# Support extensions to protocol.
# Attempts to port on wxWidgets and abstract databaselayer has been start but not finished.

== Very short history ==
* Project initially start by Alexander Lebedev from New Voice company and based on [http://derdack.com/ Derdack] proprietary SMPP library.
* Then it was transferred to O-range company. 
* New requirements and protocol extensions dictate search other, free and open SMPP library reimplementation. It was borrowed from great project [https://sourceforge.net/projects/smpprouter/ SMPPRouter]. Reworked and extended.

=== Project not used many years. Published for history ===
And of course with hope it may help someone.
